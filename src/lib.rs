//! General purpose hex decoding library with a conservative MSRV and dependency policy.
//!
//! You're currently looking at the stable crate which has advanced features removed to make
//! stabilization quicker and thus allowing downstream crates to stabilize quicker too. To get the
//! full feature set check the lower (0.x.y) versions.
//!
//! ## Stabilization strategy
//!
//! Because downstream crates may need to return hex errors in their APIs and they need to be
//! stabilized soon, this crate only exposes the errors and two basic decoding functions. This
//! should already help with the vast majority of the cases and we're sufficiently confident that
//! these errors won't have a breaking change any time soon (possibly never).
//!
//! If you're writing a binary you don't need to worry about any of this and just use the unstable
//! version for now. If you're writing a library you should use these stable errors in the API but
//! you may internally depend on the unstable crate version to get the advanced features that won't
//! affect your API. This way your API can stabilize before all features in this crate are fully
//! stable and you still can use all of them.
//!
//! ## Crate features
//!
//! * `std` - enables the standard library, on by default.
//! * `alloc` - enables features that require allocation such as decoding into `Vec<u8>`, implied
//! by `std`.
//! * `newer-rust-version` - enables Rust version detection and thus newer features, may add
//!                          dependency on a feature detection crate to reduce compile times. This
//!                          feature is expected to do nothing once the native detection is in Rust
//!                          and our MSRV is at least that version. We may also remove the feature
//!                          gate in 2.0 with semver trick once that happens.
//!
//! ## MSRV policy
//!
//! The MSRV of the crate is currently 1.63.0 and we don't intend to bump it until the newer Rust
//! version is at least two years old and also included in Debian stable (1.63 is in Debian 12 at
//! the moment).
//!
//! Note though that the dependencies may have looser policy. This is not considered breaking/wrong
//! - you would just need to pin them in `Cargo.lock` (not `.toml`).
